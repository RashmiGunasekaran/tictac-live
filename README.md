how it was to get started on the app
I found this assignment extremely fascinating as it eases representation and extension of features abundantly.I initially set up my application in Rails 6 and preferred ember-cli over ember -rails trying to keep the frontend intact extendable for testing later.
I am using a windows PC which eventually took a dependency slog when combing rails with ember.

where you found
key information to help you in your development,
Though I have solid hands-on experience with other js frameworks like react and vue,Ember was a relatively new framework.I enjoyed learning it on the go while developing the task.Th ember official documentation was helpful in my insight over the architecture and development.
 which parts of development were easy
or difficult for you,
Designing the X and Os of the tictac game with a tinge of CSS was
While DB designing choosing a has store while also using my sql was interestingly
Adding on hard and easy levels and placing relevant moves accordingly was the best part so far.
what you would improve were you given more time,
I would add in signed in user levels tracking feature where the user can take over from the place he left the game earlier while signoff.
users can choose symbols of their choice to play with in the boxes
I would want to try deploying this app for once.

working with ember and rails is what I enjoyed as it was insightful and challenging with the system resources I have right now.

Navigation Guide for my tictac app
step 1:enter name,email and choose any difficulty level
step2:play by placing the moves on clicking any box of your choice
step3:once the game is complete click on rematch or reset for same level new game or continuing a fresh game respectively.
