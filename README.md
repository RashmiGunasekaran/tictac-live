I found this assignment extremely fascinating as it eases representation and extension of features abundantly. I initially set up my application in Rails 6 and preferred ember-cli over ember-rails trying to keep the frontend intact extendable for testing later.
I am using a windows PC which eventually took a dependency slog when combing rails with ember.

Though I have solid hands-on experience with other js frameworks like react and Vue, Ember was a relatively new framework. I enjoyed learning it on the go while developing the task. The ember official documentation was helpful in my insight over the architecture and development.

The easiest part of the development was the action logics I had to write with different levels.
The difficult part was the dependency resolving with ember, rails, mysql combination.

Given more time I would add in signed-user level-tracking feature where the user can take over from the place they left the game earlier while signoff.
I will add a feature for users to choose symbols of their choice to play with in the boxes.
I would also want to try deploying this app for once.


The best part was designing the X and O of the tic-tac game with CSS notations, DB designing with hash store for positions of tic-tac while also using MYSQL, adding on hard and easy levels and placing relevant moves accordingly was the best part so far.
I enjoyed the most working with ember and rails, as it was insightful and challenging with the kind of minimal system resources I have right now.

Navigation Guide for my tic-tac app
step 1:
Enter name, email and choose any difficulty level
step2:
Play by placing the moves on clicking any box of your choice
step3:
Once the game is complete click on rematch or reset for same level new game or continuing a fresh game respectively.
